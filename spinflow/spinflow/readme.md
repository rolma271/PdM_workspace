# SpinFlow

## Project Overview
SpinFlow is a responsive LED system based on the NUCLEO-F429ZI development board paired with an MPU9250 IMU sensor. 
This project detects spin motion and adjusts NeoPixel LED colors according to the direction of the spin, otherwise it displays a default color when idle.

## Features
- **Motion Detection**: Detects spinning motions using the MPU-9250 sensor.
- **Dynamic LED Response**: Changes LED colors based on the detected spin direction.
- **Idle State**: Displays a predefined color when no motion is detected.

## Hardware Requirements
- NUCLEO-F429ZI Development Board
- NeoPixel LED strip
- MPU-9250 IMU sensor
- Power supply for LEDs and board
- Cables and connectors
